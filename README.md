# How is risk analytics helping the banking sector?
Many banks are yet to recognise analytics as an important and strategic pillar. There are three primary areas of risk in banking: credit, market, and operational risk, all of which require policies and a level of risk analysis
# Credit risk
When an individual applies for a loan or any kind of credit, a process called underwriting begins. This process often begins with an automated screening based on credit scores, payment history, and debt to income ratio.

However, other factors also go into calculating credit risk, such as geographical locations or the borrower’s occupation. As a result, the practice can be vulnerable to human bias – a danger that automated risk analysis mitigates against. Helping to create a system that is fairer and more efficient.

Risk analysis can also be harnessed to better manage and leverage a bank’s assets. For example, it can help to inform important decisions about what credit to pay off, what to maintain, and when to increase cash reserves rather than borrow.
# The likelihood of risk
Risk is at the forefront of the banking industry concerns, and predictive analytics can help banks to take some control of the uncontrollable via forecasting and establishing probabilities, predictive analytics can help with.

1.Credit scoring - predictive analytics can enable better analysis of actual credit risk tomorrow rather than just historically.
2.Fraud detection – early detection can lower the risk of fraud or prevent it altogether, revealing areas of weakness within systems and even individuals.
3.Cross-selling – predictive analytics can tell employees who are likely to open new lines of credit or use other banking services, improving customer engagement and sales conversion rates.

# Definition of Credit Risk
Credit risk infers the possibility of a loss emerging from a borrower’s downfall to pay back a loan or meet contractual commitments. Conventionally, it pertains to the risk arising from lenders’ inability to return the owed interest and principal, impacting the cash flows and increasing assemblage costs.

# Uses of Credit Risk
1.Credit risk analysis is a type of scrutiny to acknowledge the borrower’s ability to pay back.
2.Credit risks infer the ability of the individual to pay back what he owes; lenders usually perform various assessments to mitigate any loss that would arrive in the foreseeable future.
3.Lenders can arrive at a less quantifiable loss probability by properly evaluating such credit risks to curb the chances of loss.
# Advantages
1.A good credit risk management scheme improves the capacity to foresee, which helps evaluate the potential risk in every transaction.
2.The banks use the credit risks model to examine the degree of lending which can be financed to prospected or new borrowers.
3.Credit risk management is an alternative to traditional techniques for pricing options.
# Disadvantages
1.Risk management can be a very expensive liaison.
2.Although there are some quantitative techniques to evaluate credit risk, such decisions are inaccurate as assessing risk thoroughly is impossible.
3.Generally, lenders apply one rigid model to all mitigation approaches, which is wrong
